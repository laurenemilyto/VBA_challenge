![stock Market](Images/stockmarket.jpg)

## Description
Used VBA scripting to analyze stock market data from 2014 - 2016. The script loops through stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

  * Returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" across all years. 

## How to Use This Project
Use the VBA script in the repository to run on Multi Year stock data. The script will take about five minutes to half an hour to run, depending on the size of the dataset. See screen shots for each year of results on Multi Year Stock Data within the repository.
