# VBA Multiple Year Stock Data Analysis

# Description
Created a VBA script to analyze stock market data from 2014 - 2016. The script loops through stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

  * Returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume" across all years.
